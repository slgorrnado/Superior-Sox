                Our story starts in an Econ/Gov't classroom at a home-school co-op in Summerville, SC. Our founder, the
                beloved
                Sam Gorrell, was listening as his teacher told the more-or-less attentitive students about the final
                project
                for
                Economics.
                The students would have to create a good or service and create advertisements, a logo, and a slogan.
                Unfortunately, the young Sam Gorrell had a monstrous and offensive hole in his sock while his teacher
                was
                speaking. Suddenly, our founder had an epiphany: his good could be a sock that not only looked stylish,
                but
                also
                provided comfort and durability. And thus, Superior Sox was born. From there, our company has grown
                exponentially! In only three months, Superior Sox has made almost... never mind. We hope that our
                products
                will
                bring you joy and comfort and that you will be our first customer!
            </p1>
